all memory leaks are cleaned and program works well with the test_correctness.cpp with no leaks or errors. 


following is the valgrind output with the test_correctness.cpp

==32154== 
==32154== HEAP SUMMARY:
==32154==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==32154==   total heap usage: 568 allocs, 568 frees, 15,576 bytes allocated
==32154== 
==32154== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==32154== 
==32154== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==32154== Use --track-origins=yes to see where uninitialised values come from
==32154== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 4 from 4)
